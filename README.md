# Real-Life

Project Description- (multiplayer board game) - players must traverse the board once to keep on playing. The players that do not circle the board by losing all their money or dying, will lose. Each player is in a different economic class and given money amounts based off the classes. Each player’s turn starts off with a roll of a dice between 1-6. They will move that certain amount of spaces. In each space is an event that are either good or bad. The effects of the event is determined by the amount of money the player has. For example, if the event is the player getting food poisoning, the player can pay to go to the hospital and be treated immediately. However if the player is poor and doesn’t have health insurance, they can not move the next turn. When the players return to the starting area, they will receive more money on top of what they already have. The last person standing is the winner.

Main technologies- html, css, javascript, pixijs

Problems- The problems I’ll be facing will be more about the contents on the board. I might have a problem with different resolutions.I also might have a problem with multiplayer option if I have time to implement it.

Solutions- The different resolutions can be solved if I create a flex display and determine the size of the event squares with how much space it has. The other displays that appear will have to appear above the board.
